## Philosophy

Life is like one big game, sometimes you get unexpectedly lucky, sometimes you sweat over something tricky, and it's both fun and scary to realize that so many things can be changed by the decisions we make during our playtime. 

Scheduling is a lot like a game when you look at it this way. Each day is organized into "events", both explicit and non-explicit, that are similar to quests in a game. When you complete any quest, you gain experience, similar to how we gain a sense of accomplishment or proficiency when we complete a task.

Planeteer is a service that visualizes the game-like elements that make up a calendar. Just as we earn experience points for completing quests, Planeteer users earn points for completing tasks and can see them at a glance. We hope your days with Plantail will be just another way to play the big game that is life.
